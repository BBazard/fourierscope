# FourierScope

This project use [phase-contrast microscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-contrast_microscopy) images to produces high definition microscope images.

In particular, an implementation of the [Gerchbergâ€“Saxton algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerchberg%E2%80%93Saxton_algorithm) is provided.

More precisely, from many microscope images, with only the phase varying, an image with higher resolution is created.

This technique creates images of higher resolutions than what is possible with raw microscope images.
